            <p>This is a website created by fans of Kobo e-readers. The Kobo reader boasts an e-ink display that rivals or even surpasses the Kindle, making reading more immersive and enjoyable. Unfortunately, however, Kobo does not have as excellent a note-exporting feature as Kindle - yes, it can export your highlights and notes but only into an unformatted txt file. It's hard to believe this is a tech product from 2024. Txt files are not just rudimentary; they also almost guarantee poor readability.</p>
            <p>That's why I built this site — to help friends like me who want their reading notes to be beautiful and easy to read. Just upload your reading notes with one click and beautify them, then you can confidently share them with your friends for their enjoyment!</p>
            <p>If you're not satisfied with the default style provided by me, you can also choose to download the formatted notes in markdown format to match your own style.</p>
